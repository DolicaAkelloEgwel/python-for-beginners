    "Jupyter Notebooks offer a user-friendly and interactive environment for Python coding. I have chosen to use them for this workshop because they can be used as a kind of interactive textbook that bring together both explanations and examples.They also allow you to get an idea of how Python works without necessarily installing it on your system. However, should you wish to go forward with using Python in your projects, you will likely want to employ version control (for the sake of your own sanity), which Jupyter Notebooks aren't very suited for. Debugging and creating more modular code within Jupyter Notebooks can also pose challenges. Understanding these trade-offs will help you leverage Jupyter effectively while being aware of its limitations."
